                The Together.ai API rate limit has been exceeded. This typically happens when:
                
                1. Too many requests are made in a short period of time
                2. You're using a free tier account with limited quota (60 requests per minute)
                3. The API is experiencing high demand from other users
                
                Please try again later or consider upgrading your Together.ai account for higher rate limits.
                
                For now, I've used the data from Perplexity and other sources to provide the best analysis possible.
